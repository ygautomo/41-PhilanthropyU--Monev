### About this Course
# About this Course 
## WHO IS THIS COURSE FOR?
This course is designed for project implementers: people who work to make sure that projects succeed. This may include project managers, M&E staff, researchers, or anybody who will collect, manage, analyze or use data. 

The best time to develop an M&E plan is before a project starts, but after it has been designed. If you are still defining the problem that your project will address, or deciding on activities, this course will be less helpful. A course that may be helpful for projects still defining their strategic approach is [“Essentials of Non-Profit Strategy.”](http://courses.philanthropyu.org/courses/course-v1:PhilanthropyU+Strategy_000+1_1.0_20180402_20180527/about)

“Planning for Monitoring and Evaluation” will help you to think and plan like an M&E expert. However, this course is not designed to help you build a complete M&E system for your entire organization. Instead, this course will focus on preparing an M&E plan for an individual project: a set of activities with a defined start and end date, a group of beneficiaries and target outcomes.
