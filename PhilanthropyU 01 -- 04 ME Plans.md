### M&E Plans
# M&E Plans
This course will introduce you to many of the fundamental concepts of M&E and will help you to prepare an M&E plan for your project. Let’s take a look at the work you will do in this course. 

## CREATING AN M&E PLAN
An M&E plan is a set of documents that state which information you will collect, how it will be collected, and what you will do with the information. 

M&E plans are often required by donors. Whether or not they are required, however, M&E plans contain extremely useful tools. A well-prepared M&E plan will help your team coordinate roles and responsibilities, and it will make sure that everyone knows exactly what needs to be done - and why. 

While there are many different formats for M&E plans, most M&E plans contain the following parts: 

1. Introduction Document
2. Logical Framework (logframe)
3. Indicators Document
4. Data Flow Map
5. Roles and Responsibilities Chart
6. Plan for Data Quality Management
7. Plan for Data Analysis and Use

Together, these documents will tell you, your team and your donors exactly how you intend to collect, manage, analyze and use data. We will explain each of these documents later, and by the time you are done with the course, you will have completed the majority of your M&E plan. 

**Note**: Some organizations use the name “M&E plan” to refer to a single document that lists indicators and targets. In this course, we will call this type of document an “Indicators Document.” When we refer to “M&E plans,” we are talking about a group of planning documents, not a single document.
