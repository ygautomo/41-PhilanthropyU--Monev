# Module 1 Assignment: Introduction Document 
The first part of any M&E Plan is the Introduction Document. This document explains the goal of your M&E plan and provides some background information on your organization and your project. 

Your first assignment is to complete an Introduction Document for your M&E plan. Before you start, gather any project design or project planning documents that you already have. You may find that you have already completed pieces of the Introduction Document in these documents. You may also want to work with other members of your organization to complete this assignment.
