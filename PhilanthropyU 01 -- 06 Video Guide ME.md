## MEET NOPE
We will also be checking in with Peter Njuguna from the National Organization of Peer Educators (NOPE) every week to get his perspective on collecting and using data. NOPE is a Nairobi-based organization that supports vulnerable and marginalized populations throughout Kenya and East Africa with health and social programs. Strong M&E plans are an integral part of NOPEâ€™s strategy. In each module, he will explain how they use M&E in one of their projects.

Peter works on M&E, Information and Communications Technology (ICT), and program management at NOPE. Watch the video below to meet Peter and learn about his organization.
