###  This Course's Focus
# This Course's Focus 
M&E is a huge topic. You could get an entire university degree in M&E and still not learn everything that you would like to learn about the subject. M&E is also a subject that should be mixed into everything that your organization does, from project design to financing to fundraising. Clearly, we won’t be able to cover it all in this course! So, before we get started, let’s specify exactly what we are going to focus on.

### This course will focus on data collection and management.
There are other parts of an M&E system that we won’t explore. Other parts of the M&E system include: 
- Data Verification
- Data Quality
- Data Analysis & Use

These are all very interesting subjects that we won’t have the time to explore in this course.

### This course will mostly focus on collecting data for monitoring.
Monitoring and evaluation are equally important. A complete M&E plan will prepare for both tasks, and we will discuss how to prepare for both monitoring and evaluation in this course. However, this course will mostly focus on monitoring for two reasons: 

- Evaluation is a very complex task. Many organizations hire evaluation experts to do this properly. So, we will only begin to explore this subject.
- If you collect data for monitoring, you will be better prepared for evaluation. The information that you collect for monitoring is often the same information that evaluation experts will use.

### This course will focus on the planning part of the project cycle.
We will talk more about what this means on the next page.
