### Course Assignments
# Course Assignments 
Courses on the University don't just teach you about ideas. This course, like every course on the University, will help you to actually improve your organization. 

To do that, you will create an M&E plan for an existing project. This may be a project that is starting soon or a project that has already started. If you do not have a real project to work on, you will need to think of an imaginary project that you can plan for. 

After every module, your assignment will be to create part of your M&E plan for this project. Assignments can take a long time and require a lot of effort. However, we believe that this effort will be worth it. That is because, by the time you complete the course, you will have almost all the pieces of a standard M&E plan put together. Your M&E plan will be a valuable tool for managing your project and a document that you can share with donors. 

On the next page, you will receive your first assignment. Right now, choose which project you will plan for.

(Optional) If you have already got some project documents ready, take them out. Here are a few types of documents you may wish to find: 
- A project proposal
- A project logframe or other project plan
- Any existing data collection tools
- Any existing M&E plan
