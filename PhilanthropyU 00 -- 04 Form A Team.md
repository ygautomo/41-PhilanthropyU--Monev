### Form a Team
# Form a Team 
In this course, you will be discussing your organization's monitoring and evaluation plan. Each assignment asks you to apply what you have learned to your own organization. It can be helpful to invite other members of your team, including co-founders and team leadership, to join this course with you. Working on a team allows you to collaborate on assignments and discuss how your organization can get the most out of the tools in this course. It is recommended but **optional** that you take this course with a team of coworkers. If you wish to form a team, below are some tips on how to get started.  

**If you decide to take the course without a team, you can skip this section.**

## HOW TO FORM A TEAM 
Click on the “Teams” button on the bottom of your left side navigation panel to enter the Teams page. Start by selecting the region where you work. Next, join an existing team or start your own. Once you form a team, you will have a discussion space to communicate and plan with the members of your team.

## IDEAL TEAM SIZE 
The ideal team will have 2–6 individuals. If your team is larger than 6 members, it can be difficult to coordinate schedules and conduct discussions together. 

## IDENTIFYING TEAM MEMBERS 
The best way to find other team members is to invite your colleagues to sign up with you. Even identifying one coworker who is willing to take the course with you can form a great team of two! 

## LOCATION OF TEAM MEMBERS 
Try to find colleagues who are in your physical location so that you can meet in person to discuss the course. 

You can also form a remote team with distant colleagues or even professional connections that you meet on the course platform. Remote teams can use Skype or WhatsApp to hold discussions and work together. However, keep in mind that working with a remote team typically requires greater coordination and planning. 

## SUBMITTING ASSIGNMENTS 
You must submit every assignment individually. While we encourage you to work through the assignments as a team, each team member must submit the assignment individually. If you worked together, it is okay for each team member to submit the same thing. 

## HOW TO ENSURE TEAM SUCCESS 
Here are a few tips that will help your team work together seamlessly: 

- Identify a Leader: Select someone on the team to take the lead in getting you started and making decisions.
- Set a Schedule: Look at the requirements for the course before you even begin, and decide when your team will meet to collaborate on deadlines.
- Set Ground Rules: All team members should feel comfortable to learn and exchange ideas, so set some rules to ensure that all team members are interacting in ways that create respect, accountability, and trust.
- Be Prepared: If your team plans to meet weekly to work on each module’s assignment, make sure that you come to the team meeting having completed all of the reading and media in the module.

Have Fun!
