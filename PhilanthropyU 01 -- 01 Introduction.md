Module 1: Introduction to Monitoring and Evaluation
Welcome to this course on planning for monitoring and evaluation! We are glad to have you with us. 

If you are in this course, it is likely that you are already doing the difficult work of improving the world. If so, you know how confusing, complex and unexpected this work can be. It can be difficult to understand the causes of complex problems, whether specific solutions work, and why some projects succeed while others do not. 

This course will prepare you to use facts and evidence to understand these puzzles. Specifically, this course will teach you how to make a plan to collect, manage and use project information (data). Before we get started, let’s learn a few important terms. 

## KEY TERMS
- Monitoring
 Collecting project information regularly to measure the progress of your project or activity. This helps to track performance over time and to make informed decisions about the effectiveness of projects and the efficient use of resources.

- Evaluation
 Evaluation measures how well the project activities have achieved the project’s objectives and how much changes in outcomes can be directly linked to a project’s interventions. Together, we will refer to monitoring and evaluation as M&E.

- Data
 Data is the information that we collect about our project. Data can be collected in many ways, including with surveys, interviews or research. Data is used for both monitoring and evaluation.

- Bias
 The beliefs that you have about people, the world, or your project. Biases are not supported by data and may be incorrect.
